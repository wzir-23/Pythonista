# Pythonista scripts

This is where I keep my very small collection of Pythonista[1] scripts for iOS.

## ToDoNow
Add reminders in the Reminder app where each new reminder is prepended with 'TDN: '. 
When called, the program will return a random entry from that list.

Example:
TDN: Practice Italian
TDN: Small physical exercise
TDN: Work on ToDoNow
TDN: Pick up a good book

### Completed:
- Access reminders from iOS
- Make it work in command line mode

### Todo:
- Create basic GUI

## FastFasting
What: Keep track of intermittent fasting
My attempt at a utility for periodic fasting since I couldn't find anything
simple enough without login or subscriptions.

### Completed:
-  Start period
- Â Stop period
-  Store values in sqlite3 database
-  Create basic GUI   <-- Ugly beast!

### Todo:
- Delete period
- Edit past values
- Show duration of current or last period
- Refresh/recalculate duration
